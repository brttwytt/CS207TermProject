# Building an Audio-Responsive Mood Lamp
This repository describes how to reproduce an audio-resposive mood lamp. The lamp responds to music by lighting up red, green, and blue based on whether it detects kick, snare, or hi-hat drums in a piece of music.
This project is designed to enhance the mood of the room it is in and the song it is responding to. It is a relatively simple project to recreate, and allows room for further development.
The project is designed to evoke emotions like happiness, ease, and nostalgia. It should be considered a fun project, especially from a design standpoint.
Here are two images of the project, one of the finished product and one of the hardware design:
